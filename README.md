# Yet another syntactic structure annotation built with passion
### **[CFPlanter.org](https://cfplanter.org)**

CF stands for Cassia fistula, the national tree and national flower of Thailand. We originally aim to annotate syntactic trees for Thai language by composing a metaphor that we are planting trees for our nation towards Thai Computational Linguistics advancement.

To fasten syntactic structure construction, particularly syntactic treebank, we willingly introduce a so-called CFPlanter, web-based anotation tool, implement with passion for researchers and enthusiasts. 

## Annotation modes
*   Simple: Annotating with labeled bracket manually
*   **[Semi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8442061)**: Annotating along with artificial advisors (soon)

## Documentations
*   **[Guidelines](https://digital.library.tu.ac.th/tu_dc/frontend/Info/item/dc:138839)**: Annotation standard, particularly for Thai syntactic structures (soon)
